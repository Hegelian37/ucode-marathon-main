Ethan: Oh, hi! Good morning. So, I decided to please you, here you go.
Alice: Thank you, itâ€™s my pleasure!
Ethan: Thank you, but not all of us now live as carefree as we would like. You know, they say that the old building was closed not because of sanitary inspections, but because of the long-term disappearances of children!
Alice: That's... disturbing. I wonder how much truth there is to those rumors.
Ethan: It's hard to say, but it's definitely not something to take lightly. Especially since law enforcement seems to be involved. Stay cautious, Alice.
Alice: I will. It's just... unsettling to think about. Innocent children disappearing without a trace.
Ethan: I know, it's a nightmare. Just promise me you'll be careful. We don't know what's lurking in the shadows.
Alice: I'll do my best. Thanks for looking out for me, Ethan.
Ethan: Of course, anytime. Take care, Alice.
Alice: I will. See you later, Ethan. <3
